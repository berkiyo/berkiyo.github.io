I’ve been a longtime Linux user however, I wanted more performance for development tasks (mainly mobile development) but also the need to support the iOS platform. I have tried Hackintosh however, this didn’t work out well on my ThinkPad E480 due to issues like no audio, USB-C display out, weird keyboard issues and also the fact that bluetooth didn’t work. 

Of course, this is no fault of the device, macOS or the person who made the EFI bundle. Hackintosh will never be perfect and because I wanted more performance, I decided go with a MacBook Air as it ticked all the boxes for me. 

- Fast
- Excellent battery life
- Lightweight for travel
- Silent (no more coil whine or fan noise)
- Good keyboard
- Nice screen
- Ability to run either macOS or Linux

TBC…

It almost seems like it may be a right-of-passage for some of us, recently I have decided to switch back to macOS as my primary operating system as iOS development is something I want to continue.
